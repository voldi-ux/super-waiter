This is the mobile version of my own online fast food store. It is connected to my own food store api and the server app can be found at [https://github.com/voldi-ux/superWaiter-server](https://github.com/voldi-ux/superWaiter-server)


# Features :

Clients can oder online.
They can also pay online using the stripe api.

and many more


# note
make sure to use your own stripe public api key if you have one else just use my own.
to replace my api key with yours, goto  /src/sreens/checkoutScreen.js and replace the key with your key.


Feel free to fork the project and do whatever you wanna do with it
